React-ToDo

This a ToDo-List built with ReactJS, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

Set up:

    1. Run:
        $ git clone https://github.com/Eddymogollon/todo-react.git
        $ cd todo-react
        $ npm install
        $ gulp
    2. You should see: `App listening on port 3000!`
    3. Wait for the JS to compile, once it says `Finished compiling js!` the app is working!
